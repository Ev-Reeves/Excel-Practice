# Excel-Practice

A homework assignment on Excel. See 'assignment-instructions' for full details.
Starting with the 'StarterBook' file, I added additional columns using various formulas.  Some columns were color coded using conditional formatting.  I created several pivot tables and pivot charts to summarize and visualize the data, centralizing different variables (i.e. creating views based on success/failure, project category, goal amount).
